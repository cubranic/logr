Title: Logging framework in the R idiom
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Davor Cubranic <cubranic@stat.ubc.ca> [aut, cre]"
Description: Logr provides a logging framework that aims to be easy to
    adopt and use, minimally intrusive, and compatible with R's
    existing messaging functionality. It puts these goals over
    likeness to Log4j, even if it means sacrificing some of its
    capabilities (and, I hope, the baroqueness of its API) in the
    process.
